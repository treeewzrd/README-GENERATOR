## Tests
 ### 1. **Unit Tests (If applicable)** If you have written unit test for specific functions (like testing the `generateMarkdown` function or license related functions), you can run them using a test framework like Jest. 
 #### **Running Test with Jest**: 
 1. Install Jest as a development dependency (if not already installed): 
 ```bash npm install --save-dev jest 
 2. Add a test script to the j.son file: json "scripts": { "test": "jest" } 
 3. Create test files in a __tests__ folder or with .test.js file extensions to test specific functions FOr example: javascript // generateMarkdown.test.js import generateMarkdown from './generateMarkdown'; test('should generate markdown with the project title', () => { const data = { title: 'My Project' }; expect(generateMarkdown(data)).toContain('# My Project'); }); 
 4. Run the tests: 
 ```bash npm test 
 2. Manual Testing If you dont have unit tests and want to manually test the application: 
 1. Run the application using the following command: 
 ```bash node index.js 
 2. Go through the prompts and enter the necessary information. For Example: Enter the Project Title. Provide a description. Choose a License 
 3. verify the generated README.md file to ensure that: The project title appears correctly at the top of the file. All sections (Description, Installation, Usage, License, etc) are populated with the information you entered. The table of contents links pointto the correct sections.The license badge and notice aree correctly displayed for the chosen license. 
 4. Edge Cases: Try entering invalid data (e.g., empty strings, unsupported characters). test the prompts in different scenarios to ensure the app handles various user inputs appropriately. 
 3. Automated File Gneration Testing To automate file creation testing: 1. You could write a script to check if the README.md file was created after running the app, and verify that the file contains specific text. For example, you could check that the file includes the project title: 
 ```javascript const fs = require('fs') const path = './README.md'; test('should generate a README file with the project title', () => { const data = { title: 'My Project' }; fs.writeFileSync(path, gneratMarkdown(data)); // Simulate file generation const readmeContent = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8'); expect(readmeContent).toContain('# My Project'); }); 
 4. Cleaning Up Once tests are complete, be sure to remove any test files or logs created during testing if needed.

 ###Key Points to Include in Test Instructions: 
 - **Automated Testing**: Instructions for setting up and running tests (If applicable). 
 - **Manual Testing**: How to manually verify the functionality of the app by interacting with it. 
 - **Edge Case Testing**: Ensuring that the app handles unexpected or inavlid inputs. 
 - **file Generation verification**: Checking the output file to ensure it's generated correctly. 
 - **Automated tests for File Generation**: If desired, testing whether 'README.md' file is being created correctly.
